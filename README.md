# [ info ]
  
It's almost Christmas and Santa came a bit early this year! And so, because you, anarchy players, were behaving very badly this year, you are receiving **COAL** for Christmas. Don't act surprised, if you still play anarchy 1 year after discovering it, you're already used to eating shit and receiving shitty presents, aren't you?

Since our first Konas crack people have been asking us to crack Future nonstop, and the reason why we weren't touching it is because there was no reason to do so.
RusherHack has a lot more useful utility mods than Future does and Future loses to 3arthh4ck in PvPs. RusherHack got cracked by us a week after we released the first Konas crack, and 3arthh4ck is free.
  
Not only that, but Future got worse over time. 0x22 started pasting features from 3arthh4ck and just making stuff worse, for example the GUI and HUD look like shit now ([click here for shitty comparison](https://crystalpvp.ru/future/comparison.png)). Then 0x22 got crystalpvp.cc server access and he started making serverside bypasses that only users with Future could do, so if you packetlogged Future's packetfly and just replaced some values in your packetfly code then your packetfly would magically start working again.

# [ issues ]

If something fails then you might need to check your java installation. We recommend using corretto JDK 8 for running this
